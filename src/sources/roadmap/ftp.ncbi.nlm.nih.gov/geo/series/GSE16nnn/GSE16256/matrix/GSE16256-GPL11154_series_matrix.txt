!Series_summary	"The human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are a unique model system for investigating the mechanisms of human development due to their ability to replicate indefinitely while retaining the capacity to differentiate into a host of functionally distinct cell types. In addition, these cells could be potentially used as therapeutic agents in regenerative medicine. Differentiation of hESCs involves selective activation or silencing of genes, a process controlled in part by the epigenetic state of the cell. In order to gain a better understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms regulating differentiation of hESCs, and produce general reference epigenome maps of the human cells, we propose to establish an Epigenome Center in San Diego. Our center will be focused on both undifferentiated hESC and four hESC-derived early embryonic cell lineages including extraembryonic endoderm, trophoblast, mesendoderm (a common precursor to mesodermal and endodermal lineages), and mesenchymal cells (a specific mesoderm derivative). We have developed and validated high throughput technologies for mapping the state of DNA methylation and chromatin modifications throughout the genome, and will use these methods to generate high-resolution maps of the reference epigenomes. Specifically, we will grow and differentiate hESCs into multiple lineages, and map DNA methylation sites using a newly developed technology that combines bisulfite conversion and whole genome shotgun sequencing. We will also determine the histone modification status in the genome by performing both ChlP-chip and ChlP-Seq analysis. We will develop advanced statistical and algorithmic solutions to facilitate high-throughput sequencing data analysis, and establish an informatics pipeline for collecting, storage, and distribution of epigenome maps. Finally, we will perform integrated data analysis to identify new epigenetic patterns in the genome that could provide insights in mechanisms of epigenetic regulation."

protocol: Five µg of genomic DNA was extracted from frozen cell pellets using the DNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and spiked with 25 ng unmethylated cl857 Sam7 Lambda DNA (Promega, Madison, WI). The DNA was fragmented with a Covaris S2 (Covaris, Woburn, MA) to 300-500 bp, followed by concentration and size selection with AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter Genomics, Danvers, MA) at 0.9 X volume, then end repair with dCTP-free dNTPs and addition of a 3'A base. Paired-end cytosine methylated adapters (Illumina, San Diego, CA) were ligated to the sonicated DNA at 16degC for 16 hours with T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs). Adapter-ligated DNA was isolated by two rounds of purification with AMPure XP beads at 0.9 X volume. Adapter-ligated DNA (450 ng) was subjected to sodium bisulfite conversion using the MethylCode kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) as per manufacturer's instructions. The bisulfite-converted, adapter-ligated DNA molecules were enriched by 4 cycles of PCR with the following reaction composition: 2.5 U of uracil-insensitive PfuTurboCx Hotstart DNA polymerase (Stratagene), 5 µl 10X PfuTurbo reaction buffer, 31 µM dNTPs, 1 µl P7 primer (10 µM), 1 µl Primer5+3 (10 µM), for a final reaction volume of 50 µl. The thermocycling parameters were: 95degC 2 min, 98degC 30 sec, then 6 cycles of 98degC 15 sec, 60degC 30 sec and 72degC 4 min, ending with one 72degC 10 min step. The reaction products were purified using AMPure XP beads at 0.9X volume (two rounds).  Two separate PCR reactions were performed on subsets of the adapter-ligated, bisulfite-converted DNA, yielding two independent libraries from the same biological sample."

PolyA selected RNA was eluted in 2x Superscript III buffer supplemented with 10mM DTT and was fragmented by incubation at 94°C for 4 minutes. First-strand cDNA was synthesized with the following reaction composition: 0.5 µL random hexamer, 0.5 µL RNase Out, 1 µL DTT (100 mM), 0.5 µL dNTP (25 mM), 0.5 µL SuperScript III (20 µL final). The reaction was incubated at 25°C for 10 min then 50°C for 50 min.  Single-stranded cDNA was isolated by purification with RNAClean XP beads (Beckman Coulter Genomics, Danvers, MA). The dUTP-containing second-strand was synthesized with the following reaction: 1.5 µL NEBuffer 2 (NEB), 1 µL dNTP mix (10 mM dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dUTP), 0.2 µL RNase H, 1 µL DNA Polymerase I (E. coli) (New England Biolabs) (15 µL final).

TruSeq adapters (Illumina, San Diego, CA) were ligated to the dUTP-containing cDNA at 16°C for 16 hours with T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs). Adapter-ligated cDNA was isolated by two rounds of purification with AMPure XP beads. The dUTP-containing strands were digested at 37°C for 30 min with uracil DNA glycosylase (Enzymatics). Adapter-ligated, single-stranded DNA molecules were enriched by 10 cycles of PCR with the following reaction composition: 5 µL TruSeq PCR Primer Cocktail (Illumina), 25 µL TruSeq PCR Master Mix (Illumina) (50 µL final).

PolyA selected RNA was eluted in 2x Superscript III buffer supplemented with 10mM DTT and was fragmented by incubation at 94°C for 4 minutes. First-strand cDNA was synthesized with the following reaction composition: 0.5 µL random hexamer, 0.5 µL RNase Out, 1 µL DTT (100 mM), 0.5 µL dNTP (25 mM), 0.5 µL SuperScript III (20 µL final). The reaction was incubated at 25°C for 10 min then 50°C for 50 min.  Single-stranded cDNA was isolated by purification with RNAClean XP beads (Beckman Coulter Genomics, Danvers, MA). The dUTP-containing second-strand was synthesized with the following reaction: 1.5 µL NEBuffer 2 (NEB), 1 µL dNTP mix (10 mM dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dUTP), 0.2 µL RNase H, 1 µL DNA Polymerase I (E. coli) (New England Biolabs) (15 µL final). The reaction was incubated at 16°C for 2.5 hours. The dUTP-containing cDNA was isolated by purification with AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter Genomics, Danvers, MA). The dUTP-containing cDNA was then end repaired and a 3’ A base was added. TruSeq adapters (Illumina, San Diego, CA) were ligated to the dUTP-containing cDNA at 16°C for 16 hours with T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs). Adapter-ligated cDNA was isolated by two rounds of purification with AMPure XP beads. The dUTP-containing strands were digested at 37°C for 30 min with uracil DNA glycosylase (Enzymatics). Adapter-ligated, single-stranded DNA molecules were enriched by 10 cycles of PCR with the following reaction composition: 5 µL TruSeq PCR Primer Cocktail (Illumina), 25 µL TruSeq PCR Master Mix (Illumina) (50 µL final).

Adapter-ligated DNA (450 ng) was subjected to sodium bisulfite conversion using the MethylCode kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) as per manufacturer's instructions. The bisulfite-converted, adapter-ligated DNA molecules were enriched by 4 cycles of PCR with the following reaction composition: 25 ul 2x KAPA HiFi HotStart Uracil+ReadyMix, 2.5 ul Primer 1, 2.5 ul Primer 2 (50 ul final). The thermocycling parameters were: 95C 2 min, 98C 30 sec, then 4-8 cycles of 98C 15 sec, 60C 30 sec and 72C 4 min, ending with one 72C 10 min step. The reaction products were purified using AMPure XP beads (two rounds). Up to three separate PCR reactions were performed on subsets of the adapter-ligated, bisulfite-converted DNA, yielding up to two independent libraries from the same biological sample."
