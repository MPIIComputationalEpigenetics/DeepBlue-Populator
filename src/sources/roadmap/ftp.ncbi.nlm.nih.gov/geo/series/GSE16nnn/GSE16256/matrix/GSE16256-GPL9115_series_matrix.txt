!Series_summary	"The human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are a unique model system for investigating the mechanisms of human development due to their ability to replicate indefinitely while retaining the capacity to differentiate into a host of functionally distinct cell types. In addition, these cells could be potentially used as therapeutic agents in regenerative medicine. Differentiation of hESCs involves selective activation or silencing of genes, a process controlled in part by the epigenetic state of the cell. In order to gain a better understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms regulating differentiation of hESCs, and produce general reference epigenome maps of the human cells, we propose to establish an Epigenome Center in San Diego. Our center will be focused on both undifferentiated hESC and four hESC-derived early embryonic cell lineages including extraembryonic endoderm, trophoblast, mesendoderm (a common precursor to mesodermal and endodermal lineages), and mesenchymal cells (a specific mesoderm derivative). We have developed and validated high throughput technologies for mapping the state of DNA methylation and chromatin modifications throughout the genome, and will use these methods to generate high-resolution maps of the reference epigenomes. Specifically, we will grow and differentiate hESCs into multiple lineages, and map DNA methylation sites using a newly developed technology that combines bisulfite conversion and whole genome shotgun sequencing. We will also determine the histone modification status in the genome by performing both ChlP-chip and ChlP-Seq analysis. We will develop advanced statistical and algorithmic solutions to facilitate high-throughput sequencing data analysis, and establish an informatics pipeline for collecting, storage, and distribution of epigenome maps. Finally, we will perform integrated data analysis to identify new epigenetic patterns in the genome that could provide insights in mechanisms of epigenetic regulation."

"Library construction protocol: Five µg of genomic DNA was extracted from frozen cell pellets using the DNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and spiked with 25 ng unmethylated cl857 Sam7 Lambda DNA (Promega, Madison, WI). The DNA was fragmented with a Covaris S2 (Covaris, Woburn, MA) to 100-150 bp, followed by end repair and addition of a 3' A base. Cytosine-methylated adapters provided by Illumina (Illumina, San Diego, CA) were ligated to the sonicated DNA at 16C for 16 hours with T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs). Adapter-ligated DNA was isolated by two rounds of purification with AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter Genomics, Danvers, MA). Adapter-ligated DNA (450 ng) was subjected to sodium bisulfite conversion using the MethylCode kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) as per manufacturer's instructions. The bisulfite-converted, adapter-ligated DNA molecules were enriched by 4 cycles of PCR with the following reaction composition: 2.5 U of uracil-insensitive PfuTurboCx Hotstart DNA polymerase (Stratagene), 5 µl 10X PfuTurbo reaction buffer, 31 µM dNTPs, 1 µl Primer 1, 1 µl Primer 2 (50 µl final). The thermocycling parameters were: 95C 2 min, 98C 30 sec, then 4-8 cycles of 98C 15 sec, 60C 30 sec and 72C 4 min, ending with one 72C 10 min step. The reaction products were purified using AMPure XP beads (two rounds). Up to three separate PCR reactions were performed on subsets of the adapter-ligated, bisulfite-converted DNA, yielding up to three independent libraries from the same biological sample."

The bisulfite-converted, adapter-ligated DNA molecules were enriched by 4 cycles of PCR with the following reaction composition: 2.5 U of uracil-insensitive PfuTurboCx Hotstart DNA polymerase (Stratagene), 5 µl 10X PfuTurbo reaction buffer, 31 µM dNTPs, 1 µl Primer 1, 1 µl Primer 2 (50 µl final). The thermocycling parameters were: 95degC 2 min, 98degC 30 sec, then 4-8 cycles of 98degC 15 sec, 60degC 30 sec and 72degC 4 min, ending with one 72degC 10 min step. The reaction products were purified using AMPure XP beads (two rounds). Up to three separate PCR reactions were performed on subsets of the adapter-ligated, bisulfite-converted DNA, yielding up to two independent libraries from the same biological sample."
